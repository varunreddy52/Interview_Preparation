Well, I'm currently working as a Technical Lead at HCL America Inc. and working with the client Quest Diagnostics an American clinical laboratory at the client headquarters Secaucus, New Jersey location. Before that I worked with Business Intelli Solutions Inc with the same client. 

I did my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science.

<b>My Responsibilities in Day to Day</b>: <br>
My responsibilities at the current job like enhancing the existing system and building new applications. Although I am not from the healthcare background, I learned/analysed the business and did the development according to the requirements. 

In almost all the projects we used Agile/Scrum practices for the development with the sprint length of 2/3 weeks and used to track all the activities in the rally/JIRA. Design, development, and unit testing will be done to ensure the quality. Functional testing will be done by the separate team in some projects and we used to write e2e tests using cucumber framework. I am always initiative to take the ownership for the tasks during sprint planning.

After each deployment, I used to perform regression/sanity testing including the edge case scenarios to ensure nothing is broken. Whenever we encounter an issue, we check the Splunk logs, analyze it and able to detect the defect and fix it immediately. 

After the UAT, we will be preparing the implementation plan and go review it with the whole team.

My main strength is like I am well organized. Breaking the bigger tasks into multiple small chunks and complete one by one and integrate them in all. <br>
